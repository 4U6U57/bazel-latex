# Bazel rules for LaTeX

This repository provides [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) rules for LaTeX,
strongly inspired by [Klaus Aehlig's blog post](http://www.linta.de/~aehlig/techblog/2017-02-19.html)
on the matter.

These rules are still of pretty low quality. We hope that by placing
them in a publicly accessible repository, their quality will improve
over time.
